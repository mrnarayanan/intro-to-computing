Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab12.asm. Identify the cause of each error.
Ln 14: The opcode for the first command is missing.
Ln 16: The first command must be .ORIG; the program can't start with an LD command. 
Ln 17: The offset is supposed to be 9 bits, not 16. All you put is offset, not actual address.
Ln 19: There were 2 commas after the first operand, causing LC3 to think the operands are illegal.
Ln 30: The offset is supposed to be 9 bits, not 16. All you put is offset, not actual address.
Ln 32: BRpz was used instead of BRzp. This mistake caused label OUTERLOOP to be misinterpreted. 
Ln 35: The offset is supposed to be 9 bits, not 16. All you put is offset, not actual address.
Ln 43: The .END command is missing. 

Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 
OUTERLOOP         x3004
INNERLOOP         x3005
INPUT             x300E
ZERO              x300F
NEG               x3010
ANS               x3011

Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?
It makes more sense to use labels because the label will refer to a specific address, which is easier for you to keep track of. The offset will be computed automatically, which saves you trouble and makes it a lot easier to move lines of code around, since you won't have to recompute the new offset yourself.
