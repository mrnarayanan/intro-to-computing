You should take 4 integers (x,y,j,k) as your input variables.


The three constraints are defined here:

The circle C is defined by the equation: x*x + y*y = 5*5
Line G is defined by the equation: -16x + -12y = 0
Line H is defined by the equation: -7x + 10y = 17



Your function F is specified here:

If the point (x,y) lies below the line H,
calculate and print the value of the following polynomial:
(51*y)+(-5*x)+(9*j)

Otherwise if the point (x,y) lies outside the circle C,
calculate and print the value of the following polynomial:
(80*k)+(17*j)+(-54*y)

Otherwise,
calculate and print the sum from 1 to the absolute value of k of i^3 * j
